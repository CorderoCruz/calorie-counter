# CalorieCounter

This project is to help me track my calories for the week and my weight loss progress. For now, the project is not deployed since I am using it locally, later on, I plan on adding authentication and making this project available for all.

## Development server

If you would like to use this application for your own weight goals, you can fork this repo and work with your own database, I am currently connecting to my own API in a different repo called macro-API.
